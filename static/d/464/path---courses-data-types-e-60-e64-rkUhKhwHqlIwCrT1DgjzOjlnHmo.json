But that is only true on\nthe surface, the truth is that JavaScript has several types.\nUnderstanding how they interact together, what they <em>mean</em> will help\nclear up common misconceptions and make JavaScript seem much more\npredictable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Type safety is a popular topic in modern JavaScript Applications. A\nsolid foundation of types in the language opens a door to exploring what\n“type coercion” is, why it exists and how to avoid it entirely.
