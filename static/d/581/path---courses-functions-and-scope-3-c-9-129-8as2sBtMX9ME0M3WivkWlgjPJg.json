Did you know that everything is a function? No? How about binding functions to Objects? Closures? Learn the digestible rules of arrow functions and when to use them best. What the heck is a this anyway? Become familiar with scope and context in JavaScript and use them to your advantage. By the end of this course, you will become familiar with all of these topics and more.","tags":["Refactoring","Debugging","Refactoring","Context","Closures"],"title":"Functions and Scope"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/courses/Functions-and-Scope/"}}
